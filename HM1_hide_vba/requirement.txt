I have I have a sheet called Inputs that has a simple macro already setup to pull in info from other sheet in the workbook. 
Once that macro button is hit and pulls in the data from the other sheets I need the following to happen.

I have a drop down list in C39 (1-10). Based on the number selected I need C40 - C49 to auto fill with “Company A”. 
So for example if 3 is selected in the drop box then cells C40, C41 and C42 will automatically fill with “Company A” and whatever cell in the range of C40 - C49 that are not filled need to be hidden. 
Ideally if possible I would like to have the cells prefill with the default of “Company A” but for there to possibly be a drop down in cells C40 - C49 where the user could change the company (company A-Z).

In cell C66 of the Inputs sheet I need a yes/no drop down. If no is selected in the drop down. I need for the sheet called Current to be hidden.
In cell C67 of the Inputs sheet I need a yes/no drop down. If no is selected I need for the sheet called Proposed to be hidden.

At the bottom of the Inputs sheet I need a drop that allows the user to select the sheets in the workbook they want to export. 
Sheets are Current, Proposed, Percent Change, All. 
There are other sheets in workbook so All needs to only export Current/Proposed/Precent Change. 
I need a button that will ask Does everything look correct? 
If so, press this button to export. This button would need to export sheets selected from the drop down.
